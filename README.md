## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to predict the **Manufacturer‚Äôs Suggested Retail Price (MSRP)** of cars using various features such as make, model, year, engine specifications, and more. The project is based on the examples and code from the **Machine Learning Bookcamp** by Alexey Grigorev.

## Dataset Description üìä
The dataset used in this project is from the **Machine Learning Bookcamp** GitHub repository. It contains the following columns:

- **Make**: Make of a car (e.g., BMW, Toyota)
- **Model**: Model of a car
- **Year**: Year when the car was manufactured
- **Engine Fuel Type**: Type of fuel the engine needs (e.g., diesel, electric)
- **Engine HP**: Horsepower of the engine
- **Engine Cylinders**: Number of cylinders in the engine
- **Transmission Type**: Type of transmission (e.g., automatic, manual)
- **Driven_Wheels**: Type of driven wheels (e.g., front, rear, all)
- **Number of Doors**: Number of doors a car has
- **Market Category**: Category of the car (e.g., luxury, crossover)
- **Vehicle Size**: Size of the vehicle (e.g., compact, midsize, large)
- **Vehicle Style**: Style of the vehicle (e.g., sedan, convertible)
- **highway MPG**: Miles per gallon (mpg) on the highway
- **city mpg**: Miles per gallon in the city
- **Popularity**: Number of times the car was mentioned in a Twitter stream
- **MSRP**: Manufacturer‚Äôs suggested retail price (target variable)

## Usage üõ†Ô∏è
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook or Python script provided in the repository.
2. Run the code to load the dataset, preprocess the data, and train the machine learning model.
3. Evaluate the model's performance and make predictions on new data.
